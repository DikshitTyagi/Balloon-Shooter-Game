# Balloon-Shooter-Game
What the game is all about?
------------------------------
The simple plot in this game is that there will be balloons moving all over the screen. The player will have a target like an arrow and with the help of a mouse, the player has to bust those moving ballons. There will be a counter for busted balloons and on busting each moving balloon successfully, the busting score will increase.

What we will use?
----------------------
For the development of the Balloon Shooter Game using Python PyGame, we will use various pygame modules to add different functionalities to the game. We have to code for continuous movement of balloons, a shooting functionality, and updating the score every time the balloon is busted. All these functions can be done using various modules like draw, mouse, render, etc.

For the balloon’s color and shape, we will make use of the draw module that provides various functions for shapes like ellipses, circles, etc. Therefore, in order to interact with the system and above all, to add functionality like quit game and resume the game, we will use the sys module and add functionality that is based on random events we will use the random library. Apart from these libraries, we will also use the math module.

Now that we know the basic libraries and modules that we will use for the development of this game, let’s get started with some rules of the games and the flow of the code.


Game Rules to keep in mind:
-------------------------------
* It should be a single-player game.
* The game should be able to keep track of the total number of ballons busted.
